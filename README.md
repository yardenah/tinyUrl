Developed a URL shortening service that converts long URLs into short, shareable links. Built using Java and Spring Boot, the application utilizes RESTful APIs for creating and managing shortened URLs. Integrated MongoDB for managing user data, Cassandra for storing user click data, and Redis for mapping short URLs to their long counterparts. The project was containerized with Docker for deployment.
